# Introduction #

A subpage of [Admin](http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/Admin).

This page displays all non-finalized assignments for the current active semester.  When the check box for a specific assignment is checked and the form is submitted, that assignment is broken and removed from the datastore.  After form submission the page redirects to FinalizeSuggestedAssignments.
