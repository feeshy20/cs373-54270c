# Introduction #

A subpage of [Admin](http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/Admin).

This page contains two drop down fields.  The first field contains all unassigned TA's for the current semester.  The second field contains all classes for the current semester that have at least one open slot for a TA.  Once both fields have been selected and the form is submitted, that match is created and inserted into the datastore.  The page then redirects to FinalizeSuggestedAssignments.
