Administrators will:

  # Input, view, and edit the list of classes that need TAs. For each course, the administrators will input:
    # the class number/name (e.g. cs302)
    # the instructor's name
    # the expected enrollment
    # the number of TAs needed
    # the number of TAs assigned.
  # Make queries of the system, like:
    # show me the Applicants who specify Networks as their area of specialization
    # show me the Applicants, in rank order, who specify cs302 as a course they feel qualified to teach
    # show me the Applicants, in rank order, who are native English speakers and have specified Operating Systems as their area of specialization
    # show me the Applicants who have TA'ed cs352 previously
    # show me the classes for which the estimated TA allotment is 2
    # show me the classes that will be taught by Downing
    # show me the classes that have not been assigned a TA
    # show me the classes that John Doe is assigned to TA.
    This list of queries is illustrative, but not exhaustive.
  # Ask the system for suggested assignments via the SMP algorithm.
  # View, edit the assignment of TAs to classes.
