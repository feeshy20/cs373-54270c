The Assignments subpage for Admin has two links:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/AdminAssignmentsSuggested Suggested Assignments], which runs the SMP algorithm
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/AdminAssignmentsClassesTA TA Assignments], which displays a list of TA's and the classes that they are assigned to.  This will have a selector which indicates whether to list by TA or list by course.
