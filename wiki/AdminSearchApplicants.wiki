This form has four criteria fields:

  # Area of Specialization - valid input is:
    * 0 or more areas selected
  # Course Name qualified to teach - valid input is:
    * 1 - 3 characters
    * followed by exactly 3 digits
    * followed by 0 or 1 character(s) 
  # Option to show only applicants whose native language is English- valid input is:
    * any input is valid, checked or not checked 
  # Course name of previously TA'd course - valid input is:
    * A first name made of characters
    * followed by a required middle initial with an optional period
    * followed by a last name made of characters 

There should be an extra field with a list of options which allows the user to specify if they want the search results ordered.  The list should contain the following options:
  * No ordering
  * Order by applicant

Later we might add more ordering options, for now 'by applicant' is fine.
