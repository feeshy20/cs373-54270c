#summary Summarizes the TA1 project for cs373.
= Introduction =

The proposed system for assigning TAs is analogous to match-making
software (think E-Harmony).

= Local URL =

http://localhost:8080/

= Details =

The are three groups of users for the proposed system:

1. [http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/TA TA]'s will specify their background and the (types of) courses they are best qualified to TA

2. [http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/Faculty Faculty] will specify the (type of) graduate student(s) they would like to have serve as TA(s) in their class

3. [http://code.google.com/p/cs373-54270c/wiki/Admin Admin] will edit and/or accept the matchings suggested by the
system

This page has one field, a login field:
  * valid input is one of either "ta", "admin", or "faculty"

Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the appropriate page.
