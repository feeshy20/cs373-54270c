#summary Summarizes the TA1 project for cs373.
= Introduction =

The proposed system for assigning TAs is analogous to match-making
software (think E-Harmony).

= Details =

There are three groups of users for the proposed system:

1. WikiApplicants will specify their background and the (types of) courses
they are best qualified to TA

2. Instructors will specify the (type of) graduate student(s) they would
like to have serve as TA(s) in their class

3. Administrators will edit and/or accept the matchings suggested by the
system
